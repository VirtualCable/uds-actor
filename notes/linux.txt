We can use:
    * XDG Autostart (system‑wide) 
      Place a .desktop file in /etc/xdg/autostart/. 
      This is portable across desktop environments and works for all users, but only in graphical sessions.

    * Systemd user service (global)
      Install a unit file in /etc/systemd/user/ and enable it with systemctl --global enable.
      This ensures the app starts very early in the user session, even without a graphical desktop.
      Recommended if you want robustness and early startup.
      Needs systemd.

    * /etc/profile.d script
      Add a script in /etc/profile.d/ to launch the app.
      This will run for all users when they log into a shell, but it’s not guaranteed for graphical sessions.

    * System service (root) Run the app as a system‑wide daemon via /etc/systemd/system/.
      This starts at boot, not at user login, so it’s only useful if the app doesn’t need to be tied to a user session.

For Systed user service:
    systemctl --global enable udsclient.service

unit for systemd user service (save as /etc/systemd/user/udsclient.service):
```
