We can use:
    * Login Items (per‑user): Easy, but only for known users. Not suitable for “all users” installations.

    * LaunchAgents (/Library/LaunchAgents): Best option for “all users, at login” in a session context.
      Place a .plist file in:
        - ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ → for the current user only.  
        - /Library/LaunchAgents/ → for all users (runs when any user logs in).

    * LaunchDaemons (/Library/LaunchDaemons): For background daemons that don’t need a user session.
      Place a .plist in /Library/LaunchDaemons/. This runs at system boot, not user login, so it’s for services that don’t need a GUI.

    * MDM profiles: For enterprise/managed deployments.
      - In managed environments (enterprise, education), you can push LaunchAgents or Login Items via MDM profiles.
      - Scales well for fleets of Macs.

* Server (LaunchDaemon)
    Path: /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.virtualcable.udsserver.plist
    Runs as root, starts at boot.
    Handles sensitive data, IPC, or background services.
    Independent of user sessions.

* Client (LaunchAgent)
    Path: /Library/LaunchAgents/com.virtualcable.udsclient.plist
    Runs as the logged‑in user.
    Connects to the server, handles UI/session‑related tasks.
