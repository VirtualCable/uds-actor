// Shared operations trait for platform-specific implementations.
// This file defines a platform-agnostic trait with the public methods
// implemented for Windows in `shared::windows::operations`.
//
// NOTE: I use primitive types for platform-specific flags (e.g. reboot flags
// are represented as `Option<u32>`) to keep the trait cross-platform.
// The Windows implementation will convert those into the appropriate
// Windows-specific types.
